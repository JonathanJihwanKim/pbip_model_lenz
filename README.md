# Model Lenz

*Open-source static analyzer for Power BI PBIP projects. For any DAX measure, it shows every table that measure depends on (directly through the expression, and indirectly through active relationships).*

## Try it in 30 seconds (no clone needed)

```bash
uv tool install model-lenz       # or: pipx install model-lenz
model-lenz demo                  # opens a built-in 5-table demo in your browser
```

Nothing to clone. Nothing to download from GitHub. The wheel ships the CLI, a pre-built React UI, and a tiny demo PBIP.

The demo is a hand-authored 5-table model (Date, Customer, Product, Sales_fct, Measure). When the browser opens:

1. Click **Margin %** in the left sidebar. The dashed edges light up across all three dimensions, even though the expression only mentions other measures.
2. Toggle **Semantic ↔ Source** in the header. The same graph re-reads in BigQuery / Snowflake / SQL table names.

Got your own PBIP folder? Continue to [Install](#install).

## What it does

I built Model Lenz to answer one question for any DAX measure: which tables does it actually depend on?

Take `Total Sales = SUM ( Sales[Amount] )`. The expression references `Sales`. But the moment someone slices the report by Customer or Date, the result changes, because filters propagate through active relationships. Power BI Desktop's model view shows the relationships, and the formula bar shows the expression. You have to combine them in your head. I wanted a tool that just shows the combined picture.

For every measure (and for User Defined Functions, calculated columns, and calculation groups), Model Lenz surfaces:

- Direct table refs parsed from the DAX expression.
- Referenced measures (`[Other Measure]` calls), resolved transitively so the chain bottoms out at real tables.
- Indirect tables reached by walking active relationships from the direct refs, with cardinality glyphs (`*:1`, `1:*`), crossfilter direction (single or `↔`), and `USERELATIONSHIP(...)` overrides honored per measure.
- Per-table source-system lineage with confidence labels. Power BI developers see PBIP table names. Data engineers flip the **Semantic ↔ Source** toggle and the same graph re-reads in `report_sales.fact_orders_combined` (BigQuery), `dbo.DimCustomer` (SQL Server), the full Snowflake path, or whichever source the M query points at.

Same graph for both sides. When the Power BI developer and the data engineer talk about a measure in a PR or a Slack thread, they're looking at the same picture.

## Install

You only need Python 3.10+. Pick whichever installer you have. They all end with the same `model-lenz` command on your PATH.

> **Do I need to clone the repo?** No. Installing from PyPI gives you the full tool, including the bundled `model-lenz demo`. Clone the repo only if you want to contribute code or read the source.

### Windows (PowerShell), three steps

**Step 1.** Install `uv` (Astral's installer, one-time, ~10 seconds):

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

You only do this once per machine. If `uv --version` already prints something, skip it.

**Step 2.** Install Model Lenz as a global tool:

```powershell
uv tool install model-lenz
```

This downloads the latest `model-lenz` wheel from PyPI and registers a `model-lenz` command on your PATH (in `~\.local\bin\`). No clone, no Python project setup.

**Step 3.** Open a *new* PowerShell window (so the PATH update is picked up), then run:

```powershell
model-lenz serve "C:\projects\Sales\Sales.SemanticModel"
```

Replace the path with your `*.SemanticModel/` folder. That's the one Power BI Desktop creates next to your `.pbip` file. The browser opens automatically.

- *Path has spaces?* Wrap it in double quotes: `model-lenz serve "C:\My Reports\Q4 Sales\Q4 Sales.SemanticModel"`.
- *Prefer pointing at the PBIP root?* That works too. Model Lenz auto-detects the `*.SemanticModel/` child. See [Point it at your PBIP folder](#point-it-at-your-pbip-folder).

### macOS / Linux, three steps

**Step 1.** Install `uv`:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Skip if you already have `uv`. If you have `pipx` and prefer it, you can use `pipx install model-lenz` in step 2 instead.

**Step 2.** Install Model Lenz as a global tool:

```bash
uv tool install model-lenz
```

**Step 3.** In a new shell session, run it against your `*.SemanticModel/` folder:

```bash
model-lenz serve path/to/Sales.SemanticModel
```

### Already have Python and just want it in your environment?

```bash
pip install model-lenz
```

(Not recommended. `uv tool` / `pipx` keep `model-lenz` isolated from your project Pythons.)

### Updating to a newer version

When a new release lands on PyPI, your installed `model-lenz` will keep running the older version until you upgrade it. One command does it:

```powershell
uv tool upgrade model-lenz
```

(macOS/Linux: same command. With pipx: `pipx upgrade model-lenz`.)

After upgrading, fully close the existing model-lenz browser tab and stop any running server (Ctrl+C in the terminal). Then run `model-lenz serve` again. Your browser should pick up the new bundle automatically. If it doesn't, hit **Ctrl+F5** (or **Cmd+Shift+R** on Mac) to force-refresh past the cached JavaScript.

To confirm which version you have:

```powershell
model-lenz version
```

---

## Point it at your PBIP folder

PBIP saves your project as a folder tree:

```
Sales\                                      ← the PBIP root (what Power BI Desktop opens)
  Sales.pbip                                ← the project file
  Sales.SemanticModel\                      ← the model. Point here.
    definition\
      tables\*.tmdl
      relationships.tmdl
      expressions.tmdl
  Sales.Report\                             ← report layer (PBIR). Not read by Model Lenz.
                                              See PBIP Lineage Explorer for visual lineage.
```

`model-lenz serve` accepts any of these three paths. They all parse the same model:

| Path you pass                                       | Works? | Notes                                     |
|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------|
| `Sales\Sales.SemanticModel`  *(the model folder)*   | ✅ recommended | The folder Model Lenz actually reads. |
| `Sales`  *(the PBIP root, containing `Sales.pbip`)* | ✅      | Also works. Model Lenz locates the `.SemanticModel/` child automatically. |
| `Sales\Sales.SemanticModel\definition`              | ✅      | The innermost folder still works.        |

---

## Troubleshooting

- **"`pipx` is not recognized" on Windows.** Use `uv tool install` instead (see [Install](#install)). `uv` is a single-binary installer and doesn't need pip.
- **`model-lenz` isn't found after install.** Open a *new* terminal window. The installer added a directory (`~/.local/bin` on Linux/macOS, `%USERPROFILE%\.local\bin` on Windows) to your PATH, but existing terminals don't see it until they restart.
- **Browser doesn't open automatically.** It prints the URL. Copy `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/` into your browser. Add `--no-browser` to suppress the auto-open.
- **"Address already in use".** Pick a port: `model-lenz serve … --port 8765`.

## Features

| | |
|---|---|
| **PBIP format** | TMDL semantic model only (no legacy `.pbix` in v1). Reads `definition/tables/*.tmdl`, `definition/relationships.tmdl`, `definition/expressions.tmdl`, `definition/functions/*.tmdl`. |
| **DAX coverage** | Measures, User Defined Functions (preview syntax), calculated columns, calculation groups, `USERELATIONSHIP` hints, table-arg DAX functions (FILTER, ALL, CALCULATETABLE, …). |
| **Power Query** | Per-partition lineage. Connectors: `GoogleBigQuery`, `Sql.Database`, `Snowflake`, `AzureStorage`, `Csv.Document`, `Excel.Workbook`, `Web.Contents`, `SharePoint`, `OData`, `Json.Document`. Resolves cross-query references to surface the deepest known source. |
| **Relationships** | Active and inactive, all four cardinalities, single and bidirectional crossfilter. Walker honors filter-propagation direction and re-enables inactive relationships when a measure declares `USERELATIONSHIP(…)`. |
| **Classification** | Heuristic fact / dim / parameter / time / calc-group / other, configurable via a `model_lenz.toml` in the PBIP root. |
| **Distribution** | Single Python wheel. Install via `uv tool install model-lenz` (recommended) or `pipx install model-lenz`. Frontend bundle is included; no Node required at install time. |
| **Read-only** | Model Lenz never modifies your PBIP files. |

## Roadmap

Model Lenz exists because Power BI developers and data engineers need to look at the same model and have the same conversation about it. Everything on this roadmap serves that handshake. It surfaces model changes early, in a vocabulary both sides recognize, on a surface both sides can review.

- **v0.2. Shared review surfaces.**
  - Calculation groups in the graph view; calc-column visualizations.
  - **Shareable URLs** that capture the selected measure, Semantic/Source toggle state, and walk depth. Paste a link into a PR or Slack thread and both sides land on the exact same view. No more "which view are you looking at?"
  - **Export to Mermaid / SVG** for embedding sub-graphs in pull requests and design docs.

- **v0.3. Change-impact conversations.**
  - **PBIP diff view.** Point Model Lenz at two refs (`main` vs `feature/x`) and see which measures' direct *and indirect* table-dependency sets changed. A data engineer can preview which BI measures break before renaming a source column. A BI developer can show a data engineer exactly which warehouse tables a new measure now reaches.
  - **Per-measure / per-table Markdown handoff cards.** One-pager exports a BI developer can paste into Jira, Slack, or a PR description when asking the data engineer about a specific column or relationship.

- **v0.4. Guardrails before the merge.**
  - **`model-lenz check` for CI.** Extends `summary` into a policy-gate command that can fail a build on orphan measures, fact tables sourced from more than one warehouse, ambiguous propagation paths through multiple facts, or measures whose indirect-table set grew by more than N tables in a single commit. Catches anti-patterns at PR time, before they become a review thread.
  - **Annotation layer on sub-graph exports.** Reviewers leave inline comments on an exported SVG/Mermaid sub-graph attached to a PR.

- **Later.** DMV / XMLA mode for deployed semantic models. `.pbix` adapter. Perspective-aware views. Bus-layout (Kimball-style dims-top / facts-left) auto-arrangement for star-schema review.

> **Not on this roadmap by design:** report-layer (PBIR) measure-usage, meaning which pages and visuals consume each measure. That's exactly what **[PBIP Lineage Explorer](https://github.com/JonathanJihwanKim/pbip-lineage-explorer)** is for. Use Lineage Explorer for visual → DAX → source-column tracing, and use Model Lenz for the model-side dependency picture.

## Also by Jihwan Kim

- **[PBIP Lineage Explorer](https://github.com/JonathanJihwanKim/pbip-lineage-explorer)**. Trace any visual back to its source columns through DAX. Browser-based, 100% client-side. Use this when the question is *"where does the number on this card actually come from?"*
- **[PBIP Documenter](https://github.com/JonathanJihwanKim/pbip-documenter)**. Generate bidirectional documentation (measures, tables, relationships, M-steps, native SQL) from PBIP/TMDL in seconds. Use this when the question is *"can I hand someone a readable spec of this model without writing one?"*

Together with Model Lenz, the three tools cover the model side, the report side, and the documentation side of a PBIP project without overlap.

## FAQ

**Does Model Lenz modify my PBIP?**
No. It only reads. All processing is in-memory; nothing is written back to the model files.

**Does it need an XMLA endpoint or live AS connection?**
No. It works purely from the PBIP source files on disk. Source control is the only prerequisite. No Power BI Service or Tabular Editor required.

**What about legacy `.pbix` files?**
Not supported in v1. `.pbix` is a zipped legacy bundle. The TMDL-based PBIP format is the going-forward source-of-truth and supersedes it. If there's strong demand, a `.pbix` adapter could land in a later release.

**Does it scan my report visuals?**
No. Model Lenz reads only the `.SemanticModel/` side of a PBIP. For tracing which pages and visuals consume each measure (visual → DAX → source column), use **[PBIP Lineage Explorer](https://github.com/JonathanJihwanKim/pbip-lineage-explorer)**.

**Does it execute DAX or run queries?**
No. It's purely static analysis. Lexical parsing of expressions, walking the relationship graph. Nothing connects to a real data source.

**Why isn't the indirect-table list deeper by default?**
Default walk depth is 2 hops, which captures the typical star or snowflake. Adjust via the depth selector in the header or `?depth=` on the API.
